This directory contains an Android Studio project for the hello client.

The hello client is the Android equivalent of our command-line demo
of the same name.

To use this app start an Ice/hello server from any language mapping
and enter the server's host name or IP address in the app's "Host"
field.

Refer to the README file in the server's directory for more information
on starting the server.
