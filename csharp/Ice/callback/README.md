A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a proxy
to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the [server call
back][1] into an object provided by the client as part of that invocation.

To run the demo, first start the server:

| .NET Framework 4.5 | .NET Core 2.0        |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `server`           | `dotnet server.dll`  |

In a separate window, start the client:

| .NET Framework 4.5 | .NET Core 2.0       |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| `client`           | `dotnet client.dll` |
