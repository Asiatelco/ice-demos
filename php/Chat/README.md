This demo is a PHP client for the [ZeroC Chat Demo][1]. It connects to a
single chat room, allowing you to chat with other chat room participants.

By default, the demo connects to the chat server hosted on demo.zeroc.com
through a WebSocket reverse proxy hosted on zeroc.com.

Follow these steps to install the demo:

1) Install the Ice extension and run-time files as described in the
   [manual][2]. Restart the Web server if necessary.

2) If you have not built the demos yet, please refer to the top level
   [php/README.md](../../README.md) file for build instructions.

3) Configure your PHP-enabled web server to serve the directoy where this file
   exists.

4) Start a Web browser and open the index.html page to begin using the demo.
