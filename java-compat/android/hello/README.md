This directory contains an Android Studio project for the hello client.

The hello client is the Android equivalent of our command-line demo
of the same name. There are two ways you can use this app:

1. Start an Ice/hello server from any language mapping and enter the
server's host name or IP address in the app's "Host" field.

2. Start an IceDiscovery/hello server from any language mapping and
check the "Use IceDiscovery" box.

Refer to the README file in the server's directory for more information
on starting the server.

Refer to the [java-compat README.md](../../README.md) for build instructions.
