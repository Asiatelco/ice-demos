This demo illustrates how to write a MATLAB GUI application that invokes
ordinary (twoway) operations, as well as how to make oneway, datagram, secure,
and batched invocations.

Ice for MATLAB currently supports only client-side functionality, therefore you
must use a hello server from any other language mapping. If you want to get
started quickly, we recommend using the Python server.

After starting the server, run the MATLAB client:

```
>> Client.main()
```
