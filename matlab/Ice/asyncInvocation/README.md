This demo illustrates the use of Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI)
with a server that performs simple calculations and a client that can
call for the calculations without blocking.

Ice for MATLAB currently supports only client-side functionality, therefore
you must use a server from any other language mapping.

After starting the server, run the MATLAB client:

```
Client.main();
```
