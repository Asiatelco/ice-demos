This demo illustrates how to access a server's PropertiesAdmin facet
in order to retrieve and modify its configuration properties. This
demo also shows how the server can receive notifications whenever its
properties are changed.

Ice for MATLAB currently supports only client-side functionality,
therefore you must use a server from any other language mapping.

After starting the server, run the MATLAB client:

```
>> Client.main()
```
